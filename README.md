# Github Jobs Refactor

Refactor github jobs project with styled and compound components.

## What I need to build is: 

- Create a page that shows all the job lists from the given api below.
- Allow users to search for a job by its title or location.
- When each item is clicked, show the job details by going to another page.

## Structure

In this project, I use compound components and styled components for styling.

 - I stored all the components inside of a folder called components. 


**Icon**: https://google.github.io/material-design-icons/ (you can also use the react-icons package)

**API**: https://jobs.github.com/api. Use data from the API to create questions and answers.

I use this link to prevent from getting some CORS errors https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/ to help with accessing data from other websites that are normally forbidden by the same-origin policy of web browsers
